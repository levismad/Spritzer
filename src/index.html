			'A lot of programmers that make some of the coolest and most useful software today, such as many of the stuff we see on the Internet or use daily, don\'t have a theoretical computer science background. They\'re still pretty awesome and creative programmers and we thank them for what they build.',
			'However, theoretical computer science has its uses and applications and can turn out to be quite practical. In this article, targeted at programmers who know their art but who don\'t have any theoretical computer science background, I will present one of the most pragmatic tools of computer science: Big O notation and algorithm complexity analysis. As someone who has worked both in a computer science academic setting and in building production-level, software in the industry, this is the tool I have found to be one of the truly useful ones in practice, so I hope after reading this article you can apply it in your own code to make it better. After reading this post, you should be able to understand all the common terms computer scientists use such as "big O", "asymptotic behavior" and "worst-case analysis".',
			'This text is also targeted at the junior high school and high school students from Greece or anywhere else internationally competing in the International Olympiad in Informatics, an algorithms competition for students, or other similar competitions. As such, it does not have any mathematical prerequisites and will give you the background you need in order to continue studying algorithms with a firmer understanding of the theory behind them. As someone who used to compete in these student competitions, I highly advise you to read through this whole introductory material and try to fully understand it, because it will be necessary as you study algorithms and learn more advanced techniques.'
